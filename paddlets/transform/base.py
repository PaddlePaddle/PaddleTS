        Inversely transform the dataset output by the `transform` method.

        Differ from other abstract methods, this method is not decorated by abc.abstractmethod. The reason is that not
        all the transformations can be transformed back inversely, thus, it is neither possible nor mandatory
        for all sub classes inherited from this base class to implement this method.

        In general, other modules such as Pipeline will possibly call this method WITHOUT knowing if the called
        transform instance has implemented this method. To work around this, instead of simply using `pass`
        expression as the default placeholder, this method raises a NotImplementedError to enable the callers
        (e.g. Pipeline) to use try-except mechanism to identify those data transformation operators that do NOT
        implement this method.
